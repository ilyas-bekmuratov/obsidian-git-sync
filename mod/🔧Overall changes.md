thoughts on elite mod.
I like how it tries to bring balance to somewhat crazy pvp environment of dawnofwar2, but it sacrifices fun for it.¬†
This section is concerned with overall game changes that are uniformly applied to all factions.¬†

## Problems and solutions:¬†
### ‚ò†Ô∏èOrdo Malleus
yes, just fuck them in general. They‚Äôre so poorly designed and so game breaking that they‚Äôre a pain in my fucking asshole.¬†
So, instead of making any changes to them, I will take them apart piece by piece and integrate their units to [[üå†S.MARINES 1]] and [[ü´°I.GUARD 1]].**

### spamming units that are not supposed to be spammed
Fucking spam is a problem. I hate playing against huge blobs of universally good shit that destroys everything that exists and has no counter because it's generalist enough.
**Suggestion**:
Hard limit max number of units of the same type you can have deployed at the same time per player. All Space marine type squads limited to 3, but Orks, nids, and IG are hoard armies, so their limit is bigger by +1, so 4.
Rebalance the population cap completely by doubling it (200 max instead of 100) and rebalance the population cost for every unit separately (sm tactical squad goes from 15 with 5 per model to 30 - 10 per model; at the same time guardsmen can stay at 1 per model - 6 per squad)

### stacking aoe burn
AOE burn abilities deal way too much damage when stacked.¬†
**Suggestion**:
Split the damage into burn the ground and burn the model. There is only 1 stack of burn a model can have, but the ground on which it stands can burn as much as possible.

### op heavy armor
SM and heavy armor units can be too hard to deal with on T1, but become almost a joke against hard hitting weapons in T2. Similarly, ig can feel unbeatable with melee centric infantry armies like orks or traditional banshee eldar or nids. 
**Suggestion**:
Change the meta by adding armies to deal with other armies. Add new heroes so that for each faction there is at least 1 hero that can deal with the other faction well. FOR EXAMPLE. Warboss sucks against ig, but mekboy does very well.¬†
To make it less shit after this change, make heavy armor resistant to damage over time effects by 50%. (not all over time effects, dot specifically, like burns, radiation, etc.)

### Plasma
Plasma pistols suck because they're just bad and plasma guns suck in general because they are a no-brainer upgrade with no downsides.
**Solution**:
All plasma guns now have much slower attack speed but also much bigger bonuses against heavy armor, superheavy armor, vehicles, and heroes. This makes them weaker against regular infantry armor, leaving bolters and lasguns as a superior option against them.

### corpse disposal
Fire launchers are kinda useless late game and are almost always replaced. I propose to give them a new function, since dealing with resurrection and bonus interactions with corpses could be annoying.¬†
**Solution**:
All infantry leaves a dead corpse behind when they die, except demons and eldar wraithguards, if the target is NOT burning, or blasted into bits, or melted.¬†
- [[üíöORKS 1]] have a chance to stand back up after they die. 
- [[üå†S.MARINES 1]] corpses can get their gene-seed harvested for a return of a portion of resources that a model costs.
- [[üëΩELDAR 1]] corpses can be harvested for spirit stones that can be recovered for more red.
- [[ü§ñNECRONS 1]] corpses can not be eaten. But can be resurrected.
- [[ü™≥TYRANIDS 1]] corpses can only be eaten by special tyranids.
- [[ü´°I.GUARD 1]] and [[üééTAU 1]] leave regular corpses.

### vehicle deaths
Vehicles die too quickly, their explosions don't do shit, and their carcasses are just a cover until it gets run over by another vehicle.
**Solution**:
When a vehicle receives a deathblow that was not from an explosive damage, it stops attacking but the player still has 3 seconds to ram it to the enemy before it explodes. During this time its turn speed is reduced drastically. After that, vehicle carcass has some health and the same armor as sentinel, acting like a strong cover for units close to it, and blocking line of sight. It can be shot down to be removed in a harmless collapse.¬†
some units will be able to scavenge resources from vehicle carcasses.

### turrets
suppression is crazy good on turrets. They can be crippling even on its own if placed in a right spot and absolutely useless when placed wrong. I wanna bring those extremes closer to very useful and not really useful, and I wanna bring some potential to play around the turrets.
**Solution**:
Turrets cannot suppress on their own anymore. Their arc of fire, turn rate, damage, and damage type, their cost (req, energy, population), and even the limit to how many turrets there can be placed at the same time, must be therefore tuned individually to account for that. However, they still deal morale damage and so with other units shooting the same target it can still suppress.¬†
To prevent turtling, turrets will slowly lose energy as they shoot. Energy cannot be restored. but some turrets will have an ability that costs some requisition and replenishes energy.

### little use of global abilities
Some global abilities are almost never used because they are either not good enough or cost too much red, or because there are simply better alternatives.
**Solution**:
Tune global abilities to make them more useful for their cost or reduce the cost to accord for their strengths.  

### Accuracy on moving targets
It always felt weird that when units are firing on the move they get reduced accuracy, but if the target is moving and they stand still - it‚Äôs perfect accuracy for you. This meant that ranged focused armies easily outshot melee focused armies before they even had a chance to come close. [[ü´°I.GUARD 1]] being the biggest culprit.
**Solution**:
Introduce new weapon stat - accuracy on moving targets. I think a default value of 75% should do it. this will be tuned for each weapon.
I am planning on introducing a lot of changes that impact accuracy in one way or another.

### Dead heroes do nothing?
Strategically killing the enemy hero must do something apart from just leaving them on the ground.
**Solution**:
Race specific debuffs applied when the hero is dead.
Across all races, temporary and depleting max morale debuff ranging from -1/(#max number of models in a unit) to 0. Essentially, the morale gets lowered when the hero dies, but then slowly recovers.

### No one knows fear?
there is some true fucking horror out there and yet nobody is scared?
**Solution**:
There is already a morale system in the game, but it is basically only used to suppress. consequently, all weapons will deal some morale damage. I suggest increasing max morale individually, to 300 at least for every unit. 
basically, getting to 50% of max morale (150/300) suppresses the unit until morale restores above 50% and stays like that for 2 seconds
getting below 20% of max morale (60) makes the unit waver and a retreat bar begins to fill up over 5 seconds. when full, the unit makes a run for it. the lower their morale is, the faster it fills up, with 0% moral filling in 3 seconds. retreat bar is nullified as soon as the unit morale goes above 20%. morale regen bonus for being under suppression is increased when below 20% max morale.
dead models in the unit permanently reduce max morale by -1/(2x#max number of models in a unit), for example, one squad of guardsmen has 6 units, 300 morale total. when 2 models are dead, that's -50 to morale. so they will have 250/300 max morale when no-one is shooting at them. 
each critically wounded model with less than 20% max hp remaining will debuff half of that (-1/(4x#max number of models in a unit)). so, continuing the example, 2 more guardsmen have less than 20% max hp, so -25 to morale from the 2 wounded AND -50 from the 2 dead in a squad of 6 = 225/300max morale. 
if their commander has just died, they will get a further -1/(#max number of models in a unit) morale debuff. -50 = 175/300. now they get suppressed from just a bit of fire. this debuff will slowly go away as the cost of resurrection the hero becomes lower.
