## Total:

- When the hero is dead, all infantry is 2x more susceptible to suppression. 
    
- Considering all the other changes I made, I like where IG is now.
    
- I don’t even have any crazy ideas to change up their gameplay or even bring new heroes. 
    

### Globals:

no change

## Heroes:

### Inquisitor

- The default weapon does more damage. Because that was pathetically weak. 
    
- The targeted stun ability does less damage and doesn’t buff the damage of the inquisitor anymore, and instead applies debuff to the target enemy model to receive more damage. 
    

globals:

- summon inquisitorial operatives instead of regular stormtroopers.
    
- Fallback plan instead of banewolf. Halt the retreat of a targeted allied squad, give them +10 health regen and bonus speed for 10 seconds.
    

### Lord Commissar

- Lower damage bonus from execution to 20%, but make it so that it applies to all allied infantry nearby. 
    

globals

- Summon banewolf from inquisitor instead of Loyal to the end.
    

### Lord General

- no change
    

### new Eversor assassin

total

- yes it’s OM hero that I just put here.
    
- Unstable Metabolism changed. When the Eversor dies, his combat drugs react violently, detonating his body and dealing 20/30/55 explosive damage in a radius 15/7.5/3 around him and weapon knockback in radius 8. If the Bio-Meltdown ability is active when he dies, he deals additional 55 explosive damage at all ranges.
    

globals:

- Hypermetabolism  | T1. 75 red. Overclock the Eversor to the peak of his combat performance. He gains +100% cooldown reduction , 2 e/s and 12 hp/s for 15 seconds. Once the duration ends the Eversor takes 30% additional damage for 10 seconds. Cooldown 100 seconds.
    
- Bio-Meltdown  | T2. 175 red. The Eversor takes 10 dps and emits a radius 15 damage aura dealing 10 piercing dps every second for 22 seconds. All infantry exiting the aura continue taking damage for 3 seconds. If the Eversor dies before this ability wears off, all units in radius 15 take 55 more explosive damage. Cooldown 240 seconds.
    
- Mark  | T2. 150 red. Off-map Vindicare support reveals the location of all enemy units on the battlefield for 10 seconds. Cooldown 120 seconds.
    

  

wargear:

- unchanged.
    

### new Echlisiarchy Priest

total:

- yes, it’s that chainsaw carrying maniac from DoW. Inspires troops, drives them in religious fervor, kicks ass, makes miracles happen. 
    
- By default he has an ok melee chainsword and an ok las pistol.
    
- Aura of 50% suppression resistance.
    
- Inspiration on kill of 10% bonus damage for 10 seconds, stacking. 
    

  

globals:

- T2. summon crusaders
    
- T1. Loyal to the End ability from commissar.
    

  

weapons:

- T1. Purifying flames. Flamer. Purged by Flames ability from OM Purgation Squad. No melee resistance.
    
- T2. Giant chainsword. Big melee damage, no ranged weapon. Remove inspiration on kill. demoralize enemies on kill. 
    
- T3. Carries the company banner and a melta pistol to inspire allies around him even more. All aura effects around him are tripled. No melee resistance.
    

  

Armor:

- T1. Flak armor. Bonus health. Ability to become immune to knockback and suppression for a short while.
    
- T2. Armor of contempt. Bonus health and energy. Ability to increase damage of allies nearby aura.

- T2. Fanaticism ability to make a target infantry unit invulnerable for a short while.
    
- T3. Martyrdom. Removes penalties from death. When the hero dies, the army becomes immune to suppression and deals 30% more damage for 15 seconds. 
    

  

## Army

### T1

Guardsmen

- Commissars now can execute a guardsmen model at any time. Execution gives 15% bonus to weapon damage to all allied infantry around the squad and prevents this squad from retreating for 10 seconds. 
    
- turrets now have slightly more range. 
    
- new Priest acolyte. Alternative to getting a commissar. Grants the squad 25% passive damage resistance and the Fanaticism ability, temporarily shielding the squad from harm. The Acolyte is the last squad member to die. has the same chainsword and pistol as the commissar. Does not increase squad size. Still increases the reinforcement.
    

  

Artillery spotter

- no change
    

  

Catachan Devils

- Remove power melee damage. They still are decent in melee, but what the hell, why do they kill space marines in melee?
    

  

Heavy weapons squad

- autocannon has more accuracy.
    

  

Sentinel

- 1.3 times more health, 2 times slower repair rate. Because standing and trading against IG is insanely frustrating because he can simply repair off all damage as you fight. 
    

  

Primaris Psyker

- is now t1 unit. All upgrades still start from t2. 
    
- lower total energy
    
- Can use abilities even if he doesn’t have enough mana, but casting abilities like that has a chance to miscast, horribly. Miscast chance = 20% + mana overhead expended. Miscast instantly kills the psyker and brings a random demon incursion (bloodletters, nurglings, pink horrors, demonettes, chaos abominations). They are uncontrollable, their energy slowly drains, they vanish when their mana expires. 
    
- the item that previously allowed to use health as mana now lowers miscast chance by 50%.
    

### T2

Stormtroopers

- no change
    

  

Ogryn

- Bullgrins are now spawned at the same level as the ogryns you had. 
    

  

Chimera

Cadian Kasrkin

- faster grenade fly time. 
    
- grenades explode on impact with no delay.
    

  

Leman Russ tank

- Dozer blades upgrade. 20% damage reduction from the front. 
    

  

Baneblade

- active ability range increased
