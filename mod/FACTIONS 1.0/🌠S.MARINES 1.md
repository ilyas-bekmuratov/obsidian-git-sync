## Total
### Dead hero:
when the hero is dead, a timer shows up - 1 minute + 6* (hero level) seconds. if the hero is not revived within this timer - it's an automatic loss. max cost for resurrecting the hero is 50% more.
### Dead models:
[[ðŸŒ S.MARINES 1]] corpses can get their gene-seed harvested by apothecaries for a return of a portion of resources that a model costs.
vehicles and terminator armor now can be salvaged by tech marines to recover some of the resources.
### Base Accuracy:
Emperor's finest - 95% accuracy on ranged attacks when moving for all sm units. (stacks with ranged accuracy against moving targets)
### Superhuman Dread:
all non-terminator sm infantry has at least 5.5 speed now
### And they shall know no fear
their threshold for retreating from morale damage is 5% of unit's max morale. Makes them really tough to scare.
### Problem: losing units is devastating
Individual space marine models are too expensive to lose and losing a squad is almost always a gg in the early game with no comeback option.
*Solution:*
SM infantry model corpses can now be harvested for gene seed by apothecaries to recover some of the cost.
### Problem: oppressive infantry
Space marines can be oppressive to fight against when you are playing a horde army. If both players are playing ok, hoard army player WILL INEVITABLY lose models and give red to SM, but SM will only need to heal his units and will not give any red to the enemy from the exchange, gaining significant economic advantage because there is no need to reinforce. So, on a rare occasion when SM has to reinforce, there are ALWAYS enough resources AND time to do so.
*Solutions:*
increase reinforcement cost dramatically, double it, go crazy, like 140 req for a single tactical sm model. 140 req and 10 energy for assault marine, and so on. Make SM players actually use their DROP PODS and TELEPORT HOMERS to reinforce. So that SM players really have to walk a fine line between spectacularly overturning a dire situation and getting overwhelmed by numbers.
Make the reinforcements take forever to complete, as in same wait time as for an entirely new squad.

## Globals:
#globals 
- HERO GLOBAL for all heroes: T1 drop pod reinforcements from hero's abilities is replaced with drop pod tactical marines from global abilities bar. Make it deal more damage. give it a chance to instantly kill non hero, non terminator infantry on impact. Make the delay before it drops twice as long but random between 4-6 seconds, so SM has to really play around it. Lower its cost in red to 75, so it can be used more often.Â Can't summon more if tactical limit of 3 is reached. 
- T2. summon first company veteran tactical marines drop pod
- T2. summon first company veteran assault marines from gunship - it flies by and marines on jetpacks descend with a crash like regular jump but deal more knockback. 
- T3 orbital bombardment is boring, there is a lot of potential for it. Make it a bit different for each hero, details below.

- Can now recover gene seed from SM infantry to recover some of the cost and gain some xp. Allied sm corpses can also be recovered, and the recovery cost is granted to the owner player.Â 
- Orbital bombardment now drops a phosphex bomb after a 5 second delay, showing its position that deals anti everything damage over time and applies a burning effect that lasts a very long time on everything it touches. Double the radius of a regular orbital bombardment

### Tech Marine
Total:
- His turret doesn't suppress anymore, deals more damage, has a shorter range but a 270 degree arc of fire. 2 turrets max.
- Teleport beam now acts differently. It gives a 50% discount to reinforcements around it, or halves the time it takes to reinforce. Remove the healing aura from it. in T3 it can be used to summon terminators on it without paying any red. It takes a minute to order and during that, the teleporter beam is visible to enemies. Teleporter beam gets destroyed after the summon completes.Â 
- Can now salvage vehicles and terminator armor to recover some resources.
- Orbital bombardment is a 1 big orbital blast that after 4 second delay showing its position, starts lifting enemy infantry slowly from the center and grows in size over 6-7 seconds and then big caboom that has a chance to insta kill enemy non hero, non terminator units
wargear:
- Sniper bolter doesn't suppress anymore.Â

### new: Chaplain commander
Total:
- old brother-captain of the OM with some changes to make it less of a psycher and more of an inspiration to everyone.
- Has a different model. now is more like a force-commander without terminator armor. Not immune to suppression, doesnâ€™t stride through barriers.
- We are the hammer! is now a passive ability that is applied with every melee kill he makes.Â 

globals:
- T1. 75 red. Increase a squad's damage resistance by 30% and melee skill by 5 for 20 seconds. Cooldown 80 seconds.
- T1. 75 red. For 20 seconds, a targeted allied infantry unitâ€™s melee attacks cripple enemy infantry units, slowing them by 50% and reducing their melee skill by 5. Slow effects linger for 2 seconds. Cooldown 80 seconds.
- Instead of Orbital bombardment, orders a carpet bombing run by stormbirds, sorta like IG ultimate, but only in 1 wide line.Â 

weapons:
- nemesis warding staff. Ward is now a target ability instead of AOE.
 
armor:
- Mantle of Terra. Replace the ability from healing to channeling ability that increases weapon accuracy of the target unit both on the move and against moving enemy units, shortens their weapon cooldown and reduces the setup time of heavy weapons by half.Â 
 
utility:
- Psychic lash replaced with smoke grenade that reduces enemy ranged weapon radius and sight by 60%.Â

- Psychic AssailmentÂ  | T1. 75 red. Increase a targeted allied squad's ranged damage by 25% and weapon range by 7 for 25 seconds. Cooldown 60 seconds.
- Instead of normal orbital bombardment, burns all energy and prevents energy regeneration of the hero for a while, Creates purifying flames that spread in a circle around the hero that burns all mana of all enemy infantry, vehicles, and monstrous creatures around and deals heavy melee damage as DOT over time equal to the mana burned + the amount of mana Librarian burned. Imagine inquisitorâ€™s purgatus ability.Â 

armor:
- Armour of Fortitude. Now it is T2. now gives a force barrier ability (the one regular librarian had) instead of putting allies in the warp.Â 
- Banishing Cloak. Now it is a T1. Rites of exorcism ability now burns 70 energy from the target enemy unit, burns 50 more energy if the target is a demon.
