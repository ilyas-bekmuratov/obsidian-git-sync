## Total:

### Faction quirk:

- Almost all necron infantry (including heroes) resurrects on death with a low chance if not the last in the squad and short cd for each model. Almost like orks now do but differently:
    

(example: a model dies and, if it was not blown into pieces or burning, with 30% chance it stands back up with 50% of max health. The next time it dies the chance to stand up is 20% to stand up with 25% of max health. Then it's 10% and 12.5% of health. Models can't be resurrected after that. The chance resets when the model heals back up to 95% of max health)

- Moreover, even if it does not stand back up, it leaves a carcass in its place that can be repaired by scarabs, teleported to base together with the squad, or resurrected with an ability. The carcass can be destroyed but it has vehicle armor and 5% of models max health. It slowly regenerates health by itself slower than all necrons, and stands back up when at 50% health.
    
- If it was burning or blasted into pieces, or if the carcass is destroyed, it gets teleported back to necron base with 1% health and must be repaired to 100%. To get back up.
    
- all necrons heal over time, 
    
- all necrons can be repaired by scarabs (but no other unit, meaning other races can’t repair allied necrons). Repair spends requisition.
    
- Necron units cannot reinforce.
    
- No necrons can retreat. Instead, some of them have a teleport to building ability. The further a unit is from the teleportation target, the longer the delay between the command and the activation with a minimum of 3 seconds. Like a 60s cooldown would do. Dead models are teleported together with the living ones.
    
- No rate of fire reduction on suppression. Necrons literally don’t fear anything, they can’t. So they keep firing at the same rate, however, a sheer mass of firepower can make them slow down.
    
- Only heroes, sub-commanders, and scarabs can capture points
    
- Necrons don’t need no requisition to purchase units. Instead it can be spent in a global abilities bar to accelerate production and upgrades of all units, upgrades, and resurrection of heroes and dead models.
