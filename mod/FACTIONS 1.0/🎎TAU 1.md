## Total

- DoW Dark Crusade (not the soul storm) to make them feel like they belong in Elite mod. I plan to base the unit stats and abilities around existing units in Elite mod to simply copy paste most of the stuff and make the balance easier to make. 
    
- Strong ranged army. A few melee units. Tactically dependent
    
- 2 tactics that give army wide impact:
    

- Montka - fast strike. Firing on the move doesn't reduce accuracy. Vehicles move faster
    
- Kauyon - patient hunter. All infantry can cancel retreat if they have more than 40% health
    

### Globals:

T1. Switch tactics (Montka - Kauyon)

T3. Spawn terminators

T3. Orbital strike. Sorta like SM but each strike emits a slow moving wave that knockbacks infantry.

retinue

At the base it has 2 veteran fire warriors.

T1.  Kroot shaper. Can devour corpses (can’t eat ally tau, necrons, tyranids) to get experience. Good melee, leaps into combat with knockback instead of charging.

### Cadre Fireblade

total:

Fire Warrior Character, he comes with a Markerlight, a souped up Pulse Rifle with +1 to AP and Dmg, grants CORE units (but not DRONES as you should expect) exploding 6s with Pulse Weapons, and can give CORE models in a FIRE WARRIOR unit within 9” reroll 1s to Hit with Shooting. For 50pts he’s a cheap secondary HQ, ideal for some auxiliary Warlord Traits or Relics, as well as helping your battlelines be slightly more efficient. 

  

- Markerlight ability. All allies have 100% accuracy against the target enemy and 25% more damage.
    
- Pulse rifle for good piercing damage.

T1. Ranged weapon buff to allied infantry nearby for a short period

T2. Camo cloak. Invisible when stands still 

T3. Markerlight applies in aoe around target

  

Drones: 3 max. Any combination can be purchased

T1. Weapon drone. Good piercing damage. Cheap. dies easily

T1. Shield drone. creates a shield around a targeted allied infantry unit that soaks 300 damage and lasts for 10 seconds or until it gets destroyed then the ability goes on cd. Buying several drones gives this ability different charges. 

T2. Targeting drone. Shortens markerlight ability cd by 20%, and increases damage dealt against target by +10% (1 drone: from 25 default to 35; 2 - from 35 to 45; 3 - from 45 to 55). 

T3. Protective drone. Die last model. When the hero model dies, this drone automatically activates the invulnerability shield and dies instead.

  

## army

### T1

  

XV-15 (250 req)

• default capping unit. They could have 3 units in the squad, have the same health and infantry armor, be moving at the same speed as SM scouts, and deal about the same piercing dps because they had pulse rifles in dow1 by default. 

• basic infiltration ability and couldn’t be able to repair stuff. 

• T1 Jump packs upgrade

• T2 they could have XV-25 leader that could throw AV grenades

• T2 blaster upgrade that replaces their weapons damage type to melta and decreases their range. 

  

Shas La (350 req) 

• scouting ranger units. They could have 4 units in the squad, the same health and infantry armor, be moving at the same speed and doing the same piercing dps as Guardsmen (even though they use plasma guns in the lore). 

• T1 would be giving them plasma guns, changing their damage type to plasma. 

• T1 upgrade adds a targeting drone that has piercing dps, and increases the range of their weapons, acts like a detector unit, as well as gives a target lock ability, marking the enemy units in the targeted squad and making it so that the ranged damage the squad receives also damages their morale. I imagine it would have the same effect as “aiming what’s dat” ability of the ork shootas, but the mark would make it so that other ranged units could suppress the target by just shooting at it. The mark would only last about 2-3 seconds and then go on a short cooldown, but I haven’t thought it through.

  

Fire warriors (400 req, 30 en) 

• would be a long-range weapons squad that has a little bit of set up time (just like in the first DoW) and deals big plasma type dps, 6 units in the squad, about the same health and infantry type armor as Guardsmen. They will have a sniper range

• T1 upgrade of a veteran fire warrior with frag grenades, and another T1 upgrade – a protective drone without any guns that halves the ranged damage the squad receives for a short while and goes on cooldown. 

• T2 there could be an upgrade that removes the firing arc limit and lets them fire on the move and without setup. This will make them a very potent long-range unit especially because they will outrange everything but the likes of plasma cannon and be on the same range as other sniper units. 

  

Kroots (350 req, 30 en) 

• specialized melee units for T’Au. 6 units in the squad, same health and infantry armor like ork sluggas with melee resistance. 

• Leap instead of charge by default, like warlocks who jump and knockback instead of charging at the enemy. 

• Default ability to cannibalize corpses on the battlefield (this will require a new system that makes the dead infantry leave a corpse behind. I think tyranids, demons, and plague marines will be inedible for obvious reasons. Same as necrons). Cannibalizing would heal the units and add a substantial amount to the squad’s XP. Knowing how levels work in elite mod, this will allow kroots to become stronger than anyone on the battlefield with more hp and damage quicker than the enemies. 

• T2 upgrade. Sharper leader with power melee damage. Increases their level cap by one (from 4 to 5), allowing them to be 1 level ahead of everyone with more health damage and melee skill.

  

Droids (200 req, 20 en) 

• would have 4 models, little hp, but real vehicle armor, it’s possible to kill them with small arms fire, and that would not feel obnoxious. They will have piercing ranged damage and can still fire at point blank range but have no melee resistance. They will also have infantry small size hitboxes, so that AV don’t just one shot every model, but rather do that every now and then. 

• Repair 

• They cannot cap points but can repair 

• can auto-repair each other as long as there are 2 models in the squad left.

  

### T2

Vespids (400 req, 40 en) 

• would make for a good jumper squad that has shotgun blasters with piercing dps and power melee like catachans, with a melee resistance passive. 

• T2 leader upgrade in T2 that can push back everyone in a small circle around them as they start and finish the flight, like ASM do. Gives blast ability to knock back all enemies around the leader.

• They will also have sharper talons upgraded in T3, like genestealers have, making them do heavy melee damage. 

  

Invisible transport (300 req, 40 en) 

• (I don’t remember what it’s called and can’t be bothered to look up). Can transport infantry, decent speed and mediocre hp like eldar transport. has basic piercing damage guns

• Can infiltrate and allows to reinforce nearby infantry.

  

Skybeam artillery (300 req, 40 en) 

• basically like SM whirlwind. Vehicle armor, mediocre hp, explosive AOE damage on the long range. Decent against other vehicles. has basic piercing damage guns

• T3 to have a powerful blast with all its rockets at the same time on a targeted area.

  

Exosuit (400 req, 80 en) 

• vehicle armored walker with a setup and long-range firearms. Has railgun blasters that do melta damage and frag/krack rockets. No melee. 

• Target lock ability for big av damage

  

beast (350 req, 50 en) 

• superheavy infantry armor, like tyrant guard but with a sorta autocannon on top of it. Mediocre hp, but decent splash heavy melee and charge ability. 

• Can cannibalize. 

  

### T3

Momma ship (500 req 10 pop) 

• uber unit vehicle that can produce basic droids for a cost (20 req, 5 en. 1 pop each). Stats basically like the vehicles above, and the droids do the same damage as regular ones. 10 max.

  

Big dick tank (450 req, 125 en). 

• A tank with a railgun, like an upgraded Leman Russ. 

• Can be upgraded with more range and damage but slowing the fire-rate. 

  

Dinosaur (800 req, 180 en) 

• uber unit that deals a ton of heavy melee damage 

• charge ahead and knock back units ability

• Passively has a chance to eat an enemy infantry unit upon hit (like the ork roller does), immediately killing it and restoring some hp.
