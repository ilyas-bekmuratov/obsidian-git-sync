#orks
## Total
- Make waagh ability passive. Orks like fighting and fighting together, so they passively build up waagh as they fight and deal damage. The strength of the waagh depends on how many allied models are nearby. The red gain on death depends on how many waagh stacks are on a model. This stacks for all ork models, even allied ones.
(example: Each ork model(!) Generates an aura around it and it buffs speed, damage, damage resist, suppression resist, and the amount by 1.5%. When there are 5 squads of unupgraded sluggas nearby (30 models) their stats are boosted by 45%)

- When the Boss is dead, the army gets only HALF THE WAAGH.
- If they weren't blasted into bits and were not burning, there is a chance that an ork boy model would rise back up with half health on death, after a short delay. There is an increasingly lower chance to get back up for a single model for each time it stands back up, until it regains 90% of its maximum health again.
    
(example: a model dies and with 40% chance it stands back up with 50% of max health. The next time it dies the chance to stand up is 20% to stand up with 25% of max health. Then it's 10% and 12.5% of health. Then 5% and 5.75% of max health. Models can't be resurrected after that. The chance resets when the model heals back up to 90% of max health)
