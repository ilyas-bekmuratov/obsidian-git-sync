## Total

- when the hero is dead. there is a 20 - hero level % chance that infantry refuses to retreat and retreat goes on cooldown for 4 seconds instead but gain 20% more damage for the duration.
    
- -the idea was to bring more demons through summoning and rituals and sacrifices and corruption and stuff.
    
- -they have the same issue as space marines but that will barely be the biggest rework. Anyways, I suppose those 2 solutions outlined for SM work here too.
    
- However, with chaos, I am leaning towards leaving the reinforcement cost as it is, instead increasing the time it takes to reinforce space marine units to the same as buying a new one. 
- chaos is terrifying. deal 50% more morale damage
