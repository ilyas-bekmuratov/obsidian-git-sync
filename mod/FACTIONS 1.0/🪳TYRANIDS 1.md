## Total:

- Tyranids lack their biggest lore advantage - rapid evolution. Their units lack flexibility and cannot be used to advance evolution in either way. I want to add more upgrades and more units to mitigate that and basically make them a swiss knife horde army that evolves and adapts to the enemy.
    
- Army is crazy expensive to get going AND units are easy to lose. So, to mitigate that, units can now be consumed at the base and at the brood nest to recover (%of current health x 60/80/100/120%) of the squad's cost depending on the level. The refund doesn’t count the upgrades, so it is not too overpowered as the biggest part of the cost comes from upgrades.
    
- Also, to make them interact with that mechanic more, almost all tyranid units can devour the corpses. Devouring the dead takes a while to complete and gives the unit experience. Only tyranids can interact with tyranid corpses. 
    
- Loss of hero penalty is -50% of synapse effect +50% synapse backlash effect. Synapse effect +50% strength by default, units affected by synapse backlash now can’t get synapse effect for 3 seconds. So, the counterplay against tyranids is to get rid of all synapse creatures and the hero asap.The backlash will deal a lot of disruption to the army. Without synapse they’re kinda meh. Tyranids will have to adjust their playstyle to guard synapse creatures 
    

### Globals:

- Terraformation sucks ass. It already has huge delay in-between each pillar rising, so just fucking make the first one show up instantly. 
    

## Heroes:

### Hive tyrant

- Improved synapse is removed and is given to NeuroTyrant instead
    
- new T3 armor upgrade. Wings. Gives fly jump ability with long in air duration and knockback on landing. 
    
- The birthing pool global is removed and instead has corrosive blood ability. for a small period of time, acidic blood of tyranids becomes even more corrosive, dealing damage to all tyranids in melee splashes the attacker with a little power melee damage
    

  

### Lictor Alpha

- smaller detection radius when invisible.
    
- Terrify upgrade changes. Terminator or hero units are now stunned for 4 seconds instead of being untargetable.
    

globals:

- Instead of spawning Venom-brood, has Mycetic spores ability from Ravener alpha now.
    

  

### Ravener Alpha

globals:

- “Mycetic spores” is now Lictor’s ability. Instead has a Mawloc ability. On a visible targeted area summons a Mawloc after a small delay, sort of like a drop pod animation, but from the ground, knocks away infantry and deals big heavy melee damage to all targets in the area. Leaves behind a big tunnel, connected to all Ravener’s tunnels, but has much more health. 
    

### new NeuroTyrant (Zoanthrope alpha)

total:

- The Neuro Tyrant is a Tyranid bioform which acts as a focusing node for the shadow in the warp, liquifying the minds of its prey as it orchestrates hordes of Tyranids to victory.
    
- slow, weak, psychic shit that has great abilities and morphs. 
    
- health regen aura, synapse, psychic blast ability dealing psychic damage, has no other weapons
    

  

globals:

T1. Shadow in the warp. All enemy infantry is 2 times more vulnerable to suppression and can’t use any abilities but retreat. 

T2. Spawn Zoanthrope at base

  

auras:

T1. suck energy aura - blast sucks energy in aoe

T2. suck health aura - blast deals aoe % based damage over time.

T3. venom aura - blast is now anti everything damage over time.

T2. Damage synapse from Ravener.

### new HIVEMIND

total:

- weirdest hero, yet. off-map hero.
    
- abilities only. 
    
- Enhances army. 
    
- Transforms the battlefield
    
- possesses synaptic unit to “stay alive”, once the main model in the squad dies, hive mind is assumed dead and can’t possess another squad for a time.
    
- starting hormogaunts have neurogaunt model possessed by the hivemind.
    

  

globals:

T1. possession. hive mind takes direct control over a targeted synaptic unit. costs 200 req and 50 red. Possessed unit gains buffs and abilities depending on the upgrades of the hive mind. Abilities cost no mana. If another unit is currently possessed, the possession simply switches to a new one. Synaptic backlash is tripled in strength when a possessed unit dies.

T2. Death throes. for the next 12 seconds, targeted unit models keep fighting for 5 seconds after death, becoming uncontrollable.

  

weapons: essentially buffs to possessed unit

T1. +20% damage synapse.

T2. acidic blood synapse. Damaging units under this synapse in melee deals power melee damage to the attacker.

T3. shadow in the warp. Silence synapse that also makes enemies 50% more vulnerable to suppression.

  

armor:

T1. targeted ranged damage resistance and bonus speed ability

T2. targeted play dead ability. Targeted tyranids infantry unit drops dead, without leaving a corpse to be eaten, can’t attack or regenerate health, until receiving new command or until out of synapse range.

T2. drop spore mines.

T1. drop birthing pool (old hive tyrant ability). 

T3. drop biomass that can be devoured by tyranids. 

  

## Army:

### T1:

Hormagaunts

- Now, they have the adrenal glands leap by default, but it doesn’t increase damage.
    
- toxin sacks ability now deals damage over time. 
    
- new upgrade T2. Neurogaunt. +1 model with synapse on it. slightly more health and damage than other Hormagaunts. 
    

  

Termagants

- toxin sacks ability now deals damage over time. 
    
- new upgrade T2. Gargoyle. Gets wings, slower speed on the ground but can get temporary flight ability, basically functions like a directed jump but on a shorter cooldown and longer in-air time. Damage resistance while flying. Can’t enter vehicles or take cover now. Because they shoot from a higher angle, they will get more accurate fire against units in cover (+50% base accuracy). Meaning yellow cover does nothing against them and green cover only gives 20% damage reduction. Buildings stay the same)
    

  

Warrior brood

- now costs 360/25
    
- Barbed strangler now costs 50 req and 10 energy
    
- Venom brood is now a T2 upgrade, alternative to the other 2. Part of the weapon damage is stacking damage over time. Slower firing speed, more accuracy against all targets so that it is more effective against heavy armor. 
    

  

Ravener brood

- fleshborer guns now deal part of their damage as damage over time. 
    
- melee upgrade now grants their burrowstrike an aoe stun like stormboyz nob landing. 
    

  

Spore mines

- Explode on death. It’s strange how they didn’t do so previously.
    

  

### T2:

Zoanthrope

- 2 max like it is now, but 3 new upgrades that can be one of a kind (if there is 1 neurothrope there can’t be another, etc). Can’t devour corpses.
    
- Symbiosis is now T2 upgrade,
    
- Neurothrope is now a t3 upgrade. Can’t devour corpses.
    
- new T3 upgrade. Malanthrope. Gives up psychic powers for much better resource gathering. Devouring corpses gives red and double the regular resources.
    
- new T3 upgrade. Venomthrope. Venomous stinky shit. Slowly hovers around with AOE DOT aura that gets stronger the closer it gets. Deals 15 piercing dps in range 15, additional 15 power melee damage in range 9, additional 15 heavy melee damage in range 4. Can’t devour corpses. Doesn’t have synapse. Can spit acid that acts like a regular zoanthrope’s blast but part of the damage is damage over time.
    

  

Tyrant guard

- new upgrade T3: hive guard. Turns to a ball and dies, a level 1 hive guard is born in its place. Hive guard is basically like a tyrant guard with an autocannon. fires like a tank basically. Half the melee dps of tyrant guard. Can’t curl into a ball, still has a smash through ability. 
    

  

Genestealer brood

- invisibility now lasts for a few seconds after moving

Lictor

- Reduced detection radius when invisible.
    

  

Swarmlord

- can’t devour corpses.
    
- doesn’t have a reinforcement aura anymore, instead, has double vision range. This is to account for Swarmlord being the best commander tyranids have.
    
- targeted play dead ability. Targeted tyranids infantry unit drops dead until receiving new command or until out of synapse range.
    

  

new Tervigon 

- Uber-unit, alternative to swarmlord. The Tervigon is a massive Tyranid which serves as a living incubator capable of spawning Termagants.
