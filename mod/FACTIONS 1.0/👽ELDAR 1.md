## Total:

- When the hero is dead, the army regenerates energy 2x slower. 
    
- I like where eldars are tbh. Heroes are very much balanced and fun to play. But there is a huge problem that one cannot simply play mediocre eldar. They either suck, or are op as fuck with almost no in-between.
    
- I want to change how fleet of foot ability works. From now on, ALL eldar infantry by default dodges 15% of ranged fire on top of global ranged fire accuracy changes. Fleet of foot ability now grants only speed bonus and ranged weapon accuracy debuff to the unit that activates it. Instead of how it works now, the passive effect of this ability increases with each level of the unit, giving them more dodge chances: 15-20-25-30%. 
    
- That would honestly make eldar infantry more unkillable than they already are and I’d hate it if it went too far. So, I want to increase squad replenishment costs for eldar across the board by about 25%. They are a dying race and every eldar is a great loss.
    
- To counteract that I wanna introduce the spirit stones recovery mechanic. When eldar infantry (except wraithguards) dies, without exploding into bits or burning, it leaves a spirit stone to be recovered by anyone. Recovering it gives double red as it gives for regular dead eldar if eldar picks it up, and the same red as regular dead eldar if any other enemy or ally does. Spirit stones can’t be destroyed, because why would they.
