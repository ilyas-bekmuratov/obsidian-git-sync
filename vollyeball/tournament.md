explanation
Смотришь на строку и выбираешь команду
Например 5 "сильнейшие"
Пересечение с колонной - результат матча против соответствующей команд в пользу нашей выбранной
Красные поля - поражение, Зеленое - победа, Синие с крестиком страйк и техническое поражение
количество . показывает насколько большое преимущество/отставание было в результате матча, если нет . значит матч закончился почти равным счётом
И того:
5 vs 8 even loss against order
5 vs 3 has to be reversed as 3 vs 5 because 3 is less than 5
which means 3 loses against 5 with more 10<point advantage<16
5 vs 0 ➝ 0 vs 5 :
    

1) tall
a little bitter but it's because they're body shamed for being tall on a regular basis. they are generic, but very talented. lacking self confidence they can be scared but will not back off when they stand together. First trial of the new team, going up against naturally talented players. They will be lacking strategic thinking, coordination, and planning until Gravita starts taking control of the game to make it revolve around her.
2) unhurried and planning
they deliberately play it slow to preserve their own strength and waste the strength of their opponents more. The time will drag and it will be most unbearable for Aiona who always wants the time to go faster.
3) intuitive and quick
they think fast on their feet, make rapid decisions and run around like crazies, even though their intuition is chaotic, it can lead to good results. Sola will find herself confused by them constantly, until she manages to focus on one area of their court to defend.
4) loudest and prettiest
trash talking pretty girls who get the boys to cheer for them very very loudly. Aiona will devise the perfect plan to deal with them using the team forces: Gravita will get them down to earth, Sola will outrun them, Quanta and Quinta will do the killer combo, and Quanta will slander them down to earth. They will take away the attention of the boys from them.
5) strongest
literal strength in body, they hit the ball very hard and this can lead to trauma. Gravi will be the one to physically oppose them during the game and will get hurt giving them the first loss.
6) ex teammates
3 girls that previously played together with Quinta and Quanta but have switched schools and joined another team. Aiona will know the other 2 girls. The shame of the past will come out.
7) ordered
biggest team with a strict trainer who can replace every single one of them. they play with cruel efficiency, but no joy. The goal for our team will be to take their morale as low as possible as quick as possible.
8) better friendship
a team full of good energy and mutual support, they play for fun. the only way our girls can win against them is to pitch them against each other. This wins the game but puts a dent in team's unity.
9) respected champions
this team were the last year's champs, they respect each other and their opponents. 2 of them are going on the draft for the national team to compete on a worldwide championship, their combination is much better than Quanta and Quinta's. So the only way out for them is to genuinely play as best as they can and trick the opponents by reversing the combination.
