### origin of urge
*When did the character learn to behave in this way? How did it help them? (this is not necessary to know.)*

Her alcoholic father ([[Gravita's father]]) is absent from home most of the time, but works hard and gives a lot of material things to her.
her crazy mother ([[Gravita's mother]]) that physically abused her when she was a child, and is now trying to repent because she recognizes that it's exactly the same as it was with her own parents. Very complicated relationships.
lack of empathy from her parents hasn't taken root in her, because her Grandparents ([[Gravita's Grandparents]]) from mother's side raised her in the early years. she was cared for, loved, and cherished.
taking care of her siblings ([[Gravita's siblings]]) to the point that she almost does ALL the work for them.
being a pretty girl from youngest years, she was always treated well by others, so has accepted their kindness as something to always reciprocate with the same kindness.
taking care of her infantile boyfriend ([[Gravita's boyfriend]]) who's going through a depressive episode

### Core urge
*a compulsion (this is a general solution to a specific problem.)*
*"In order to survive / get my needs met, I must..."*

utterly overwhelmed yet can't let go of responsibilities

it's hard for her to deal with surroundings and she fears that she is dragging everyone around her into her problems, when in reality she is dragging everyone else's problems to her
