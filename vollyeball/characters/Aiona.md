### origin of urge
*When did the character learn to behave in this way? How did it help them? (this is not necessary to know.)*

her secret is that she was a rape victim in middle school and her assailant was a close relative. She got him arrested by herself because her family did not believe her.

### Core urge
**a compulsion (this is a general solution to a specific problem.)**
*"In order to survive / get my needs met, I must..."*

she doesn't stay in one place for too long, moves on quickly. whenever people start suspecting the reasons why she is so strange - she leaves.

passively suicidal - doesn't care about her own safety and dismisses it.

always at the right place at the right time - tries to help others whenever she can.
