### origin of urge
*When did the character learn to behave in this way? How did it help them? (this is not necessary to know.)*

their single mom was always picking favorites when they were little based on their performance, thinking competitiveness will push them to higher grounds. Eventually, Quanta kept winning, while Quinta kept losing, maybe it started with intentionally losing to her sister, but the divide between them has grown out of all proportions. 

### Core urge
*a compulsion (this is a general solution to a specific problem.)*
*"In order to survive / get my needs met, I must..."*

she wants to get the same amount of approval from their single mom as her sister, without the need to fall into competitive feuds. But feels compelled to compete, to win something once and prove with her sister to stop this stupid race for their mother's approval
but she is almost disillusioned with this idea of winning and is so depressed and actively suicidal.
