### origin of urge
*When did the character learn to behave in this way? How did it help them? (this is not necessary to know.)*

their single mom was always picking favorites when they were little based on their performance, thinking competitiveness will push them to higher grounds. Eventually, Quanta had to keep winning to maintain approval of their mother. But she is getting more and more lonely at the top, as the distance between the sisters increased.

### Core urge
*a compulsion (this is a general solution to a specific problem.)*
*"In order to survive / get my needs met, I must..."*

she meticulously does every single thing that will make her better than her twin. performance anxiety - must be the better twin - exhausting herself beyond any reasonable degree.
But she is struggling on every single step and trying not to break this facade, even though she wants this to end so bad.

counted as the prettiest girl among boys - sluts around and enjoys it
