difficulties of making cash with consumer apps

**network effect:**
imagine tiktok with 1 user or an uber with 1 driver
growing network and bringing people in makes more people interested in what others are doing here

the more users == more value

building networks is complicated and full of really high tech competition

moreover
there is a thing called **social proof**
going from 1 to 10 reviews is really hard
people do not leave reviews naturally

people value other people's opinions
so going to 5 review 5 stars place is not as good as going to a 4.4 star place with millions of reviews

so you have to convince people manually (compounds slowly) and you actually require an immense customer support

#feedback 
**churn**
the % amount of customers leaving every period of time

so for example
10% churn means in a year you will lose 120% of your customers

this is BAD
even 4-5% is bad


**LTV/CAC ratio** is also an important metric
The customer lifetime value (LTV) refers to the profit brought in by a customer, while the customer acquisition cost (CAC) is the expense incurred in convincing the customer to purchase the product.

so for example
it costs 45$ to acquire a new customer who gives 200$, then your ltv/cac=4.4

marketing can get complicated
but doing it in phases allows 

**ATTENTION** - is what you really need to sell your product
do not just expect it to appear once you build your tech

## phase1: #validation 
goal: get organic growth
cheap at first, but gets expensive later

1. Facebook/social-network group outreach: posts, videos, lander explaining the offer-> 
2. direct messages: get your lifetime deal offers to those first adopters. offer 100 users a lifetime deal for 90 euros. then do it again for 200. then do it again for 300
3. first 25-30 customers that are paying and willing to wait while you build it

## phase2:
goal: add paid supplement to your organic growth and get things ready for launch
1. Leads ads (get some emails in). At this point you grow by having calls and getting white glove support->
2. drip email campaign (if you're really good at copywriting do a newsletter about your product)->
3. do the **white glove support** and have calls with people to gain trust and to understand what is the **AHA moment** for your product
4. build into this specific solution and improve your product
6. adjust pricing and do the second real launch with special offers (eg. 6 months for this price + some bonus)

**White glove customer service** represents a commitment to exceeding customer expectations. The meticulous approach involves not only delivering good service but going far above and beyond the norm.
For example, when customers bring their car to your dealership for service, you provide them with a coffee and snack bar. A week later, your staff personally follows up by phone or email to check on the performance of the vehicle.
You do not need statistics to know that if you treat a customer well, they will not only consider you again in the future but also recommend you to others.

**figure out your AHA moment**
that dopamine hit the user gets for the first time
for facebook it was like getting 10 friends
for a health app it could be to get 3 meditations 3 days in a row
THEN
figure out a way to get this working asap
improve UI/UX

## phase3:
now you have a decent number of people following
so you can run a good number of ads
you already have **owned attention**

Now, you can **scale**!
