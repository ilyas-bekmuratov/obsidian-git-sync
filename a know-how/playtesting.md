[# How to Make a Better Game in Less Time](https://www.youtube.com/@aesthgame5481)

game design is like blindly stumbling forward

every game design is a hypothesis
playtest is a proof

appealing to the players is the light at the end of the tunnel

so playtest asap after 1 week of #prototyping
do it often
collect a lot of evidence

imagine this as a proof against a ton of negative reviews that would have arrived if you didn't playtest before launch

there is a thing called an illusion of skill

*trust intuition*
**=** speed of feedback **x** quality of feedback **x** experience

#doit 

be open to feedback
	get out of your own way and step over your ego
	if it's working for them ==good==
	it doesn't have to be working for you, maybe you're not target audience
	listen
	empathize
	kill your your darlings
don't focus on what they say
	playtester is a teacher and you are a student
	encourage to speak out loud
	answer their questions
	ask them why they want to make the changes they want
	but your main job is to shut up and watch
	don't prescribe the solutions. instead of "what do you think of the double jump" ask "what do you think about the movement"
focus on why they say it


#no-excuses
1) the game doesn't need to be complete to playtest -> test early
your core assumptions must be test asap
first by you
then by other players
as soon as there is nothing game breaking
tutorials can come last, just explain the bare minimum
first you make them WANT to play and then make it playable

2) ideas are free
there are a infinite amount of them
go get 50 ideas down the page everyday
get numb to the idea of ditching ideas

3) finding playtesters:
friends and family
trade testing with devs
run testing with your community
newsletter signups
go to a party - the drunker the better

4) don't be afraid to receive the feedback
worst case scenario = they hate it = you get a bunch of feedback
but the actual worst case is no feedback

5) the best sign that it's working
is when players ask when can they play more of it
