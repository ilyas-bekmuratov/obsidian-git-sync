chronic procrastination is an issue that can be sold

3 reasons to procrastinate on starting a task:
next time you can't start a task
think first about which of these 3 is it?

maybe also consult someone else -> someone who will hold you accountable, because no intrinsic accountability will not allow you to work.
Maybe simply not wanting to disappoint others is good enough of a motivation to try -> it will roll on from that
## **fear** 
- it's something really important - we don't procrastinate on things with no stakes. A project, a paper due, etc...
solutions
1) **version 0** - maybe there is a fear of failure or wasted effort. How about you clean your room and make space for work - not actually doing the thing, but do things outside of the actual work that will lead you to it. Something minimum effort, very little actually done, but making a little bit of that progress. 
2) Let go of trying to do great on the first try. It doesn't have to be perfect to be good.
## **incongruence of interest values** 
- not fearing, but like the setup of the task is not aligned with your interests it gets uncared about and so not done
solutions
1) **verify** if you actually need to do it - maybe it's not fun because you don't need to do it
2) **make it fun** and not boring or delegate
## **overwhelm** 
- there is too much to do. you didn't think fully through the steps to do the task
solutions
1) figure out the **first step**
2) do it and just that until it is completed
