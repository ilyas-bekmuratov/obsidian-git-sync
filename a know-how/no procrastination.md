chronic procrastination is an issue that can be sold

3 reasons to procrastinate on starting a task:

1) **fear** it's something really important - we don't procrastinate on things with no stakes. A project, a paper due, etc...
2) **incongruence of interest values** not fearing, but like the setup of the task is not aligned with your interests it gets uncared about and so not done
3) **overwhelm** - there is too much to do. you didn't think fully through the steps to do the task

next time you can't start a task
think first about which of these 3 is it?
