moving to promptless

starting a new claude engineer starts to log your inputs as prompts all over agin

so, moving to promptless gives you an option to pre-empt most of the input you would've had to do

simple to install
https://github.com/Doriandarko/claude-engineer

pip install requirement.txt where you want and run the name of the script and go on experimenting with it

this stuff is good to understand structure and shit and get going

consistency or obsession from overtraining?
some models can get more intelligent to give consistent answers to even the dumbest questions, but it could also just be overtraining, so being careful and doublechecking is still important

let's say there is an update on the new api
go to website
copy update notes
feed it back to ai engineer of your choice
and it learns
it can learn to use the tools to use itself

#gathering-data 
you must realize what's in the training data and what isn't, so getting it to use some shit is easier when you use fresh info in context
and if the script isn't really working, instead of staring a new chat it's more useful to get the previous result back in the context and ask the ai to correct it
