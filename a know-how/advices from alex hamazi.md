[81 Minutes of Money Making Advice You Needed to Know Yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_s0ekwPK5g&t=1s)
#life 
#perspective
long term vs short term sacrifice
it's all about that
perception of losing some things early is nothing compared to potential gains if it all works out
who cares what others think
if you get a free lottery ticket - why not use it?

#marketing 
businesses make a lot more money if people actually know about their stuff
revolutionary, wow, lmao
but your product MUST be good first
people can get marketed, but it will DEPLETE YOUR TRUST - driving your further sales to 0

#marginal-gains
working a little bit gets you like 80% of the way where you want to be
but you have to work 10 times harder for the rest, exponentially increasing your input the closer you get to 100%
similarly,
getting the basics and knowing stuff in general is easy - a summary will do
but getting the edges is harder. you need details. 

#LTV-ratio
A capped Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio refers to a restriction placed on the maximum LTV ratio a lender will allow for a loan. The LTV ratio is a financial term used by lenders to express the ratio of a loan to the value of an asset purchased. For example, if a lender caps the LTV ratio at 80%, it means the borrower must provide at least 20% of the asset's value as a down payment, while the loan can cover up to 80%. This cap helps manage risk by ensuring that borrowers have significant equity in the asset.

#metaskills
meta skills - are skills that make it easier to acquire and retain other skills. 
reading
languages
retaining information
inferring information
logic, etc

#prototyping 
but the biggest meta skill to learn right now is whether or not you can find 1 very specific problem that you can solve that is similar across different businesses

#employment
#talent-finding
#partnerships
good business owners search for people who can teach them something over the phone call
someone already experienced
who has already done a to b to z
find someone who's not just there to maintain
someone must be the one to get shit done, get excited over improvements, looks around the corner for the next big thing
someone hungry.

#teaching
#behavior
everybody knows how to learn - it's natural, though it differs for different people
very FEW people know how to teach. you gotta know how to answer these questions
1) what do i reward? 
how do i reward it. long term, but slow. rewarding for a behavior can be sustained until the behavior starts to bring inherent rewards on its own, without the need for the teacher to supply said rewards
3) what do i punish? 
punishment changes behavior faster. but short term. people can become tolerant to punishment, forget it, avoid it.
5) where do i extinguish - do nothing
neglect things to make them vanish. don't pay attention to it until it goes away

#learning
#self-improvement
#growth
how to select relevant information
system will grow until it meets constraints
find these constraints - limitations and solve them one by one.
if you solve it, and you still don't grow, then you didn't identify the constraint correctly.
sometimes the constraint is that you can't judge what's the constraint is.
this only comes from experience... ye

#brand
the point of a brand is to change and illicit a behavior that you want
simple as
pair a thing that people know with the thing that they don't know
apple pie/home/warmth - SWEET PILLOWS
motor car speed/horse strength/manliness - MAN PARFUME
Make something new from a bundle of associations.

Think of it as a Boquete - a bunch of flowers gathered together.
not a single broken, rotten, or bad looking flower - it will ruin the whole look.

you don't add a cactus to a lion to a boquete all of a sudden. lion is an animal. 
move the boquete to a warm climate
put it next to a cat
make the cat bigger and bigger 
now you have a lion next to a boquete and no one sees it as wrong.

Moving brands to a different direction is a SLOW process. 
incremental changes are very effective to smoothen the tension

#no-one-solution
there is no silver bullet
there is a death by a thousand cuts
no one thing by itself is going to make a change
it's when many-many little improvements and actions take place together, multiplying each other's effect

same with building trust with your customers
do the little extra things, like giving gift cards, personalized vids, phonecalls, etc.
many small gestures
many details that will be helpful on the long run
the sum total of all the little things is what defines and magnifies the success you could have had without them

#customer-avatar 
someone who is your ideal customer
search for them
describe their pains
speak to those pains
solved their problems

#selling
share standardized information that everyone will get beforehand when trying to sell stuff to a group
go into details and specific on the webinar
some people got less
but those who are already interested are more likely to buy

you don't sell emerging stuff
you only sell outcomes
solved problems
whatever it is

#pricing 
luxury - rolex watch - their value comes from the price
premium - bmw - their value justifies the price
regular - price justifies the value

pricing high weeds out shit customers. 
simple truth
a lot of businesses don't justify this high price
success comes from reinvesting this extra profit from high prices into a premium product
this can then merit the premium pricing

so good branding makes it obvious that whatever value 

to provide value and to explain it is key
customers must know what they're paying for
show off the details that went into the product they're buying

usually, pricing for businesses should be premium
but some of the time, the tops of your pricing that will generate money is the price that your customers are willing to pay on their worst month, because that's where the churns will come
if they can and are willing to stick with you through the tough times - great.

#growth 
ALWAYS
go for an improvement that will net you most value over price/time spent on it
having talents working with you is directly proportional to your growth.
the culture of the business that you have to attract those talents is, therefore, essential

#service-value
a lot of service value comes from them being unnoticed
good server manager, accountant, cleaner lady is the one you rarely get to see fixing a problem they caused - they don't create one in the first place.

#accounting
good accounting is similarly incredibly good for being confident about business decisions.
if you simply know what you can afford to do - you can make those decisions within these constraints with confidence

#feedback
#gathering-data
#metrics 
don't be focused on one area of the business when gathering data
be informed on all of the areas
have multiple metrics in different areas
this will give you a better perspective on how your business is actually doing

#mistakes 
when growing, keep in mind the focus you set initially
you are NOT doing everything at once
you are getting things done a few at a time

NEVER SAY : here's what YOU SHOULD DO
instead: HERE's what I DID

#b2b
b2b businesses must NOT go into governing and solving ALL of the other businesses problems - they are going to inevitably sit on your back and bring nothing
be very specific about who you work and who you don't work with
and learn to say no to people who don't stick with you
take a few steps back to run forward
severe your connection with businesses that aren't fit enough to work with you

#be-yourself
one of the biggest mistakes an individual selling his knowledge can do is to not be yourself
be yourself
authenticity proves to be incredibly more effective when you are trying to show and prove yourself to others when compared to lying and losing trust over time

#teaching 
when teaching a team
first teach them to work as one
follow the script
make them united in their actions

because if you need to make a course correction down the line, it will be impossible to establish the authority of this decision and to make them follow it uniformly well if you have a bunch of lone-wolves

if there is a problem with your script - change it later
first, make people follow the script

e.g. give them 5 bucks to follow the script
doesn't matter if they achieve the result or fail
when they are following the process, they can learn the new thing to win more
go for it.
