#mistakes 
zero-waste is not sustainable long term because people buy it only once

#growth 
biggest mistake in her business growth process was not taking up opportunities to grow rapidly and expand into different products and distribution chains

she had an option to take 5 million, but took 1 because she didn't know if she could grow the idea bigger than her starting thoughts
she had an option to get into buying and distributing a variety of diverse products, but was too slow for that and the niche got occupied

#marketing 
she was helping to market her competition with no return but reputational gains
she would film a review with them together
they would go on to sell the same product on a market place
she would earn 0 money from it
