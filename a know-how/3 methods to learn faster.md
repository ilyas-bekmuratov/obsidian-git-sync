#mistakes 

## method 1:
useless skills are useless only if you don't know why you're studying it
having a goal in mind makes studying purpose

#mistakes 
learning everything all at once

you should only research the things you really need right now
or need to be using soon

but there is no sense in learning stuff you are not using at the moment

## method 2:
pick up things that you actually need

capitalizing on your motivation and interests
if you get tired of reading -> watch videos
if you get bored of one topic -> pick up another
if you get frustrated with studying one method -> goto practicing it

**take breaks by switching actions, not by stopping actions**

## method 3:
#doit 
no point in theoryjerking
practice first
break a leg
fix it
there is no point in just theorizing and studying without using it
**passive learning does not work**
don't read a book and then do things
do things as you are reading a book


#mistakes 
lack of sleep is making you fucked up
like 2 times less effective
sleep properly
