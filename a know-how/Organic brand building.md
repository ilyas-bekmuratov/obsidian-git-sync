Audience and Traffic
+
Good product

don't worry about quality at first
go for quantity and focus on putting in effort
do not promote
#marketing 
All of your value content is given out for free until then
Think of it as seeding this goodwill

Goodwill through organic gets a massive boost from paid ads

so, when you put out free valuable stuff out there you get massive returns on paid content you give
#brand 
Funnel
Think about the free stuff as a bigger funnel to get that initial reaction - that initial view. Something to hook the widest audience.
All those who like your brand will stay for substance of the other things you do.

power laws exist.
spending 10 times more effort on a video will get you 100 times more results, not 10 times.

so get obsessed over the best things you did and scrutinize them for the value others see in it. #customer-avatar 

There are genuinely 2 ways to go about your content
**immediate gratification**
and 
**slow burner**

immediate is dropping a lamborgini from a cliff in the first minute of the video because the title of your video is "dropping a lamborgini from a cliff"

slow burner is all about gratifying results that guarantee the certainty and proof of the educational content you put out

#brand association
is getting associated with an aspect, a symbol or some such

this is power of influence (strong to weak)
direction (towards to from)
and reach (all people - no one)

so, ideal brand is Taylor swift
she is very influential on people's behavior
she pulls people towards her
she has a massive reach because almost everyone knows her

#mistakes
all publicity is good publicity is not true
but all publicity is useful, even negative publicity

so using controversy and trendy topics to gain reach can be used to gain advantage
but it also sticks to you through association

#shorts
#videoediting 
think of long form videos as a collection of shorts

anything can be content
if put together correctly

take notes on everything
drink in the data
consume it and digest it putting your own spin on it
get value out of it
dump your tweets
and keep it authentic unless your goal is to do something specific
