[Why You Struggle to Follow Through (Thinkers vs Doers)](https://www.youtube.com/@HealthyGamerGG)

There are 2 types of people
thinkers and doers

thinkers can become doers
it's a skill you can learn

everyone starts with
**curiosity** - is a desire to get more
this is phase 1 - triggered situational interest
#mistakes 
don't start with curiosity
don't engage
just focus on continued exposure

then you get to phase 2:
**maintained situational interest**
this is still extrinsic
But you get more and more exposure will get you naturally interested
learn about it - watch youtube, read books, talk and hangout with insiders, and engaging with community
#mistakes 
your brain doesn't overcome an emotional noise with effort alone
but sustaining interest from the point of curiosity will eventually lead to intrinsic motivation to learn more

phase 3: this is where you avoid switching to another topic of curiosity
**emerging individual interest**
focusing on a particular thing will eventually lead to a direct engagement
now, critical step to go into intrinsic motivation
is to start *theory crafting*
#doit
when you theory craft you engage with yourself, not anyone else
play around with information, get engaged with it, shift it around and think
thinking about it on your own will get you going

Now, thinkers continue to expose themselves to external environment. 
Thinkers are continuously thinking but do not produce any internal work
phase 4:
**well developed individual interest**
now people appear to be doers because they did not do the following earlier
1) **engaging with the opinions of others** - after you get to theory crafting you eventually start appreciating contributions of others and their own theory crafting. You get a lot of your own ideas and WANT to diversify them by observing the perspectives of others. 
#mistakes 
there is a big difference between external input and interest
when people in phase 1 and 2 try consume more info - they do not start developing their own opinions. 

2) **ask for feedback** - what you got right or wrong. 
#mistakes 
feedback can be bad at phase 1 and 2 when it's negative
getting intimidated through early feedback destroys your motivation and kills your curiosity. This is only good when your own individual interest is strong enough to push through this.
