#self-improvement 
#gamedesign
**switching your habits**

## method: second brain
plan something ahead
 - make actual solid plans to go and do shit
 - actually check on those plans regularly
 - don't fuck it up
 - #doit because when you don't you let go and don't do anything.
 - make 1 simple goal to achieve everyday, something solid and achievable

learn something
 - obviously implement it as well only when you actually do things you can consider it as learned.

screenshot or write a method to do this
- you acquired a new skill - document it

save it in your knowledgebase
- games usually keep track of player accomplishments to keep the player going and enjoying the progress - do the same

problem: I don't like to read
problem: I distract myself with anything else

**RADICAL solution:**
get rid of absolutely anything that may distract you from what you must do.
Make self improvement the only option.

switch to Linux OR make another user for windows that doesn't let you play games and use browser.
turn off your phone and put it into another room

make things interesting for yourself
motivate yourself to get something done because you want to

switch the device to one purpose thing
