this is basically about being in a bubble and not communicating outside of it
not facing new ideas
not engaging in critical thinking

this is a self-feeding cycle
staying in the same place and in the same group reduces your chances to engage new ideas
not engages new ideas reduces your willingness to get out of your bubble

staying the same means you do not evolve
this makes your life suck
