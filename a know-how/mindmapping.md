[3 Levels of Mind Maps Every Student MUST Master](https://www.youtube.com/@JustinSung)

#organizing

**there is no point in using mind maps if you're not engaging in higher value thinking!**

level 0
	wordy
	linear
	detailed
level 1
	no full sentences - take only the key points
	arrows and lines to connect ideas together
	compact space representation of ideas
level 2
	groups of information
		think more about how similar or different ideas are to each other and arrange them by similarity
	groups are related to each other
		create a structure intentionally, not randomly. think about how you arrange it. **don't avoid this higher order thinking**
	information flows
		how ideas influence each other
		think about the flow from one idea to the other
level 3
	structure and flow is much clearer
		quality of the connections and flow of ideas because it's clean
	more emphasis on groups and arrows
		bigger arrows and tighter groups on more important things (colors, sizes, and other subconscious things)
	more intuitive and memorable
		not the same terminology that is used for the topic, but more intuitive labelling

consistently creating level3 mindmaps takes a lot of thinking, rethinking of every concept that is used for level 2

so
it is possible to take linear notes like level 0
but in actuality achieve a similar thing like in level 3

explaining relationships and nuances, connections, groupings of ideas, and memorable tracking of ideas

this is harder visually, but it achieves the same results
