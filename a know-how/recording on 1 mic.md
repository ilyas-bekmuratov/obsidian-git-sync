recording sucks ass
you fuck up too much
and that's ok
get through this
music has a vibrancy and a sense of space in the real world
in digital you can't truly replicate it, but only through illusions
fuck anything that gets in the way of you creating art
you best believe that out of 60 takes somehow #12 was actually good for everyone who does music
we're not here to prove our worth
we're here to write a song

record a foundation
get a foundation a main idea going
some structure to aim for 
build something on top of it

record this thing twice
with different mic position

or

record another motive from the same position to go in the different ear

record a baseline

get shit going with the drums 
- record the whole thing, but from far away to record the room
- record the main groove without the cymbals from the knee mic
- record just the cymbals from the mic on the cymbals (a bit further from it to make it roomy)
- overlay this recording in the song track
- record each individual drum bit sound separately and in different dynamics (loud and quiet) - kick - snare - tom
- line up the one shot samples with the recording
- this must be very good timing

record all the other weird sounds that you want to use as effects

find the tones:
- get experimenting with the tones
- recording effects through pedalboard is fucked but might get interesting
- clean regular recording is good if you want to change it later
- it also might just fail spectacularly because what you hear is not really what's heard at the end
- don't worry if you get 50+ attempts and decide number 12 was the best
- mic position relative to the center of the guitar amp is fucking huge - move it a lot to find the best spot 
- then don't move it. or do if you want to fuck with eq less
- acoustic guitar is weird: the closer to the neck you place the mic - the brighter and thinner and pluckier the tone gets, but the closer you get it to the bridge - it gets more boomy and louder
- get the frequency response chart for your microphone model and try adjusting it towards it - some microphones are brighter on the higher frequencies and some are dimmer on low.

grooving and patterns:
- alternate patterns (but sometimes don't)
- keep the groove (but sometimes don't)

record the vocals:
- sing with open belly
- sing smiling
- sing in not reflective room (not empty)
- recording on optimal distance with s-filter
- if the demo (first try shit mic) is good on a shit quality recording - that's a good sign
- try doing the same on a slightly better setup
