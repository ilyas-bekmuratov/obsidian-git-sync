[How to Make a Cheap Camera Cinematic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W89eklcj3c)
1. better mic - good position - proper sound settings - de-esser, equalizer, compressor
2. clean your fucking room - looks professional
3. get some lights in the background - warm colors
4. get a light softbox up and face you from the side - ribmra lightning
5. put a diffuser on it, makes the light softer, and if possible make it warmer color
6. get a background light that makes your siluet pop
7. get some white balance
8. get the iso down (100)
9. get the camera aperture down (f3.5)
10. exposure changed, so adjust the key light from the softbox
11. shutter speed = 2 times your framerate
12. wear something that doesn't blend into the background
13. add color grading - or a filter that does it
