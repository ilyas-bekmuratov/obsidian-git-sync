1) go for a long walk with nothing
meditate for a little bit
breathe

2) focus on momentum - the air on the tips of your fingertips
the object in motion stays in motion
just get fucking started
just one tiny little bit of a step, not the whole thing
so little, that it doesn't really matter, so might as well do it, why not
then keep the momentum going with doing other shit

3) it can suck yes
but it's ok
don't take it seriously
that's it, fuck it we roll on
fear INACTION
NOT REJECTION

4) setting big targets based on results only can be demoralizing if those results aren't achieved

set action targets instead

result target: I want to lose 5 kilos
action target: I want to go to the gym 3 times a week over the next 3 months

5) simplify
perfection is lazy - gives you excuses for not doing it and overthinking instead
simple but done is hard.

no one cares for how much time and effort you put in it
they care how it's done and when they are getting it
