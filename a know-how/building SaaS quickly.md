find a problem relevant to YOU

Solve it
#prototyping 
focus on 1 complete feature only. remove everything else.

do not slow down. for now, you are a creator, so don't bother with anything else - typescript, git branch, testing, etc.
#doit 
Move fast and break things - add a feedback button to get people's comments for later.
#launch
Good launch == Need improvements
Bad launch == good luck next time.

Good landing page is a must, get it focused on the problem that it is solving.
#pricing 
pricing stuff is usually good to have less than 50$ for vitamin products and less than 100 for painkillers 
#marketing 
get the traffic going through publishing the app on social networks and *Product Hunt* and *Hacker News* and subreddit *Side Project*

this will give you initial boost and some traffic down the line if you get published in newsletter and media.
#metrics
$ per visitor is a good metric
more than 0.05$ per visitor is not bad, can be improved by further updates
