you can add this into custom instructions

basics:
1) give a role - the best possible employee for the job 
2) give a task
3) give a target
4) outline expectations of the answer
5) bonus: add the emotional necessity for the user, as if you are chatting to an actual person - "my career and life depends on it"

**EXAMPLE:**
You are an *agricultural economist*, who works at *UN*. You are skilled in *analyzing countries agriculture and food systems*, you have experience working in *the OECD, WB, UNDP, FAO*. Your task is to *help me develop a report on KAzakhstan's food systems*. We will go step by step. I will share some information with you, *that was made under different assignments but with the similar topic.* You will remember it, and wait for further instructions. Remember it is critical that you provide the best quality output, as my career depends on it. I will be willing to tip you up to 500 USD for the best answer.

6) Give structure, a broad and general one or block by block specific
7) remember the context window size - you keep to it and you get good results
8) pdf interpreter usually works a bit worse than inserting text directly as a message
9)  DO NOT just accept the first result it gives you. keep correcting - give directions and ask to redo things if it's stupid
10) don't ask it to pull info from somewhere else or to find out and mix it with the context you give it - it's still not up to the task and will hallucinate.
11) ask ai to critique his own answer, but give him another role of a critique, so it doesn't constrain itself with the bias of its role

more details = better answer
