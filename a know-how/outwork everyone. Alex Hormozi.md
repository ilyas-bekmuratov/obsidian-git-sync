[You're Not Behind: My System for Outworking Everyone](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexHormozi)
#business 
#growth 
work isn't about how hard you try
business
work = outputs
outputs per time unit = leverage x volume / time = money

volume = number of times you do the thing
leverage = how much you get out of each time you do it

same exact thing
you either make more customers
or make them worth more (buy more stuff, increase prices, buy more often)

#doit 
1) get clear on the input that grows you the most
2) remove everything that isn't that from your life

if want to be unreasonably good at it
do it unreasonably lots and lots and lots
that will be your volume

you're ONLY GROWING WHEN YOU DO WHAT IMPROVES YOU

fucking prioritize it
focus on your priorities for 4 hours a day

stupid but #self-improvement is real
all problems are solvable with skills
skills are attainable with repetition and feedback
once you have a skill, you can do it in less time
which gives you leverage
you get more for what you do

and then maintaining is 1/10th of the effort of gaining this skill

24 hours a day
there are 2 ways do things in this time
find time
buy time

#time-management
**maker time**
large blocks of uninterrupted time
4-6 hours
only 14 blocks per week
low urgency - high importance work
a productive maker calendar is an empty calendar
an interruption destroys the entire block

**manager time**
time blocks of 5-15 min
100+ work blocks per week
the goal is to fill your calendar
you are maximally productive when you have no gaps
this is usually training teams, coordinating, communicating, putting out fires

it's a disaster when these two clash

**maker habits to have**
decide on a project to work with your maker time
no distractions 
there are no emergencies
going to bed at the same time every single time
it's easy get up early once and get tired
don't drink because it costs 2 days = the day you drink and the day you recover

**buying time**
maximize the working time of your team AND yourself
you can get more productive by elimination
kill everything that is not making you productive

**EXAMPLE**
on average per month a person spends
50 hours on food (groceries, prepping, cleaning)
replacement cost = 800$/month
25 hours on cleaning their home
replacement cost = 500$/month
16 hours on laundry
replacement cost = 200$ month
driving from work and refilling gas 18 hours a month
replacement cost = 700$/month on uber

you can get 110 hours per month
just by paying 2100$ per month
#doit 
DO NOT EVER HESITATE TO DO THIS

this is reinvesting in yourself 
ONLY IF you get more shit done for doing it

following sports teams 4 hours a week
watching youtube 21 hours a week
scrolling social media 17 hours a week
videogames 10 hours a week

REPLACEMENT COST = 0
TIME GAINED = 42 HOURS

#sleep 
have a "goto sleep" alarm
not wake up alarm

#fun
most efficient fun is to have fun at work
when doing work is fun

#blocks
when you encounter a block
and correctly identify it
usually it's easiest to overwork it until it goes away 
and you encounter another block
