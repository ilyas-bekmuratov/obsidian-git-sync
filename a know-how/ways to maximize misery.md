1) move
do not stay in the same room
go out there in the sun
stillness leads to sickness
sickness leads to stillness
bedroom IS NOT ALLROOM
make your activities in separate places

2) regular sleep cycle
takes 3 days to establish
do not vary it

3) screentime to minimum
never fucking sleep with your screen on
never go grab the phone first thing in the morning

4) don't be anxious over shit that is not relevant to you
don't worry about shit you can do nothing about
don't try to do something if it's only a token action

5) set SMART GOALS
specific
measurable
actionable
responsible
time-bounded

don't set Vapid goals
vague
amorphous
pie in the sky
irrelevant
delayed

don't fucking set huge goals at once aka
i'm gonna clear the whole house today

No
do a list of small tasks
go one by one

DO NOT GO FURTHER THAN WHAT YOU WISH TO ACHIEVE YOU FUCKER
aka 
don't learn to market an app
before you learn to code

don't plan dlc
before you make a game
etc

6) setting time for action instead of waiting for motivation to strike - a time when you must do it before it gets out of hand

7) DO NOT
PURSUE
HAPPINESS

happiness is not an unreachable feeling when you're good always

happiness is like a bird that comes by when conditions are good

IT DOES NOT COME WHEN YOU WAIT FOR IT

8) OPPOSE your instincts

instincts always point towards idiotic things that lead to momentary satisfaction

the opposite of that is REGIME

go and do the shit you must because it will be better on the long term.
