## managers
divide their time into smallest chunks possible
empty time slot = lost opportunity
time literally is money for them
when 2 managers spend time together = they both gain money

the duration of their day
30 minutes before meetings
+all the time of their
their best day is the busiest day with no empty time slots

## makers
creators and entrepreneurs who build stuff
some or all of the time dedicated to work
small, not urgent, but important tasks.

they just have a few large chunks of uninterrupted time in their flow

5 minute meeting can ruin their 4-6 hour work time period

the stuff you build is the output of their time
projects that can't be done in 30 minutes

they do things not in schedule but until it's done
their best day is an empty day to do 1 single big task

## their interaction
manager managing makers is usually wrong

for a manager 1 meeting may cost 1 work unit out of 20 in that day
for a maker 1 meeting is 1 work unit out of 10 this week

if managers disrupt the work of makers by interrupting them shit goes bad

it's a lose lose situation
## applies everywhere
this also applies for networking
"let's discuss opportunities for a minute in 10am?"
aka
"let's fuck up both our mornings because i have no plan for this time, but you have to prepare for this the day before, cancel your plans in the early morning, and get little to no time left until lunch"

## solutions
attack from all directions
### to the managers
understand the costs you put on the maker
1) you disrupt them 2 times, as you plan the meeting and as the meeting commences
2) their time slots are very limited and a single disruption destroys it

steps to take:
1) be sure the meeting is worth it
2) don't get offended when they decline a meeting
3) actually ask them what time is good and combine several meetings if possible as close as possible, but keep their calendars mostly empty
4) make some days "quiet days" with no interruptions at all - no meetings, no communications
5) together with the makers set strict deadlines by when the work should be done, then you may ask why things aren't going as well if they 
6) at the end of each meeting ask yourself: does this kind of meeting need to occur again? is there a system we can replace it with?

### to the makers
good managers want to help you
send the video to the managers and tell them your time availability
have a standard meeting time open for meetings - if everyone knows everyone's time - it's much better
communicate to people that you are not going to respond while you're working, let them know when you will be responsive and when you won't

but you still have to do your fucking work when you said you will be working
otherwise managers will know you're slacking off

sometimes you have to engage in a meeting, it's unavoidable:
to make best use of your disrupted time, become a manager for this day - knock down as many meetings as you can in that formerly free time
then you can switch back

sometimes you have to work early morning or late evening
but it will ultimately be worth it
you work double time AROUND your other work responsibilities because it will not be done otherwise
#doit 
honestly, his advice is just you fuck off with your other stuff and make some time on weekends and mornings by sacrificing everything else

some days you will inevitably feel unmotivated
then, make it a manager day and fill it up with meetings and decision making
other days, when you have meetings, you may actually feel motivated, so feel free to ask for a re-scheduling of such meetings on that day, chances are they will be cancelled altogether
### for both
#communicate which hat you're wearing today
#doit get a hat, or any other object that signifies what you will be doing today, making or managing - this communicates what you will be doing not only to others but to your subconsciousness

LOOK AT YOUR SCHEDULE #doit 
allocate time for highest returns on human capital out of everything
prevent waste of time
