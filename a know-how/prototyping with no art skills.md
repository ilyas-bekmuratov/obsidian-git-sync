dodging problems

art must be good enough to communicate the game
but not too good so that the focus is only on gameplay

going into art too deeply hinders you a lot

finding people you wanna work with is kinda hard

get shit done using only art that can get you basic shapes where you need them without spending a whole lot of time on them

limit your colors
limit your shades
limit the edges of your shapes

2 things you need:
shape + readability = silhouette  

so, 
start from smallest sprite size (16x16 or 8x8)

draw in this size until it looks closer to the idea of what you wanna make

THEN for complicated poses / objects

deconstruct
brake it down to pieces, layer by layer
do the same exact silhouette thingy

THEN concepting
make a bunch of arts different and select one that's closer to desired thingy

then make variations on it based on the same silhouette and design language

TEXT
getting a text must be simple - get it readable, no need to overwork and just make 1 example for each letter to re-use

COLORRRRS
get as few colors as possible
make them look vividly distinct
take their complementary colors

there is a very basic APOLLO color palette that you can use
