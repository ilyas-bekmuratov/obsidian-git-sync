#niche
big problems - solve in products
health
wealth
relationships

solve one of these -

have you solved any of your problems - how can you help other people
if you haven't - help yourself first

#doit 
Answer with these questions!
what obstacles have you overcome in the last 5 years to be where you are now?
what's an important obstacle you're facing in your life that you wish someone could solve it for you?

EXAMPLE
problem: 
Struggling with consistency.
solve your own problem and document it: 
Creating a framework. 

**if it seems EASIER SAID THAN DONE - BINGO - YOU FOUND A PROBLEM WORTH MONEY TO BE SOLVED.**

FOCUS ON MVP FIRST - ONE THING THAT DOES IT - stand up and fucking do it.

ONLY THEN
#value
think about how you should price it according to the value you provide with the solution.
VALUE CALCULATED BY:
dream outcome - potential value
likelihood of achieving it
time delay
effort and sacrifice - cost

*I help {{niche}} get {{results}} through {{product/service}} without {{inconvenience that competitors have}}*

Identify this shit.
#authority
start by sharing value with videos/blogs/posts in social networks and establish yourself as an authority in your niche
get trust
keep doing it for a long time
gather audience
get their emails and start OWNING YOUR AUDIENCE

you only own your audience if they are connected to you through various means - different networks
be total about it ->

THEN
#pricing 
share something for free going in-depth exploring the topic you usually have of your videos
 a notion template
 ebook
 mini course

after people enjoyed the value of that free product, offer a low price (less than 50$) product
that they can buy on the spot because they know it's valuable
same shit but bigger
must be so good that people come back for more
focus on providing max value, not selling

after that go into CORE PRODUCT - expensive a lot more value
online course
coaching
mastermind
membership to a community
