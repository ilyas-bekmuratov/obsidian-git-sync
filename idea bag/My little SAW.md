## gameplay 
1) Player designs their own escape room Or Gets one of the community made ones Or Picks one from the pre-made ones 
2) Que up for a game or bring friends to play along 
3) All the maps players picked get mixed up and people go from one room to the other, solving deadly puzzles and trying to stay alive. Voice chat enabled. Dead people become SAW ghosts and can activate traps manually for further chaos.
4) Challenges in each room can vary from simply staying alive, to pressing buttons, entering codes, finding keys, sacrificing a limb or a body part, sacrificing a player. There should be an opportunity to put people up against each other and have fun.

## It’s a sandbox. It’s a party game. It’s a saw 
We have to create the sandbox and tools to make escape-rooms and traps. Community will mix and match those and people should be able to rate them. It must be simple. And it must be fun to make. 
There must be a way to complete the room in order for it to get published. Otherwise, there could be impossible rooms and that’s not fun. 
There’s no story mode. It’s a party game. But it can be competitive also, because people can compete against each other in how much time they spend to pass through a certain chain of rooms.
