a world has lost contact with the rest of the imperium of man for generations
economy, politics, and the beliefs of the citizens are divided. People are afraid, lost, and confused.
the hive city is overpopulated beyond all limits
the old planetary governor is assassinated and a bitter covert political war has begun in the senate

you are a missionary of a belief of your choice
your goal is to unite the whole planet in one faith by any means at your disposal
but beware other cults rising up.

you have a number of followers
victory is achieved when all cults with opposing beliefs are snuffed out completely by shepherding all of their followers to you or eliminating them completely.
Or the cult achieves its miracle victory by realizing their goal.
