a world has lost contact with the rest of the imperium of man for generations

economy, politics, and the beliefs of the citizens are divided. People are afraid, lost, and confused.

  

you are a missionary of a belief of your choice

your goal is to unite the whole planet in one faith by any means at your disposal
