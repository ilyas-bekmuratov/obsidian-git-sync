# AZA chapter
## origins
Sometime after the Reign of Blood during the late 36th millenia, Magos biologis Vrotter of the adeptus mechanicum has committed a grave heresy and has not destroyed the experiment of magos diabolis of the dark mechanicum, Pi-z-d1m

the experiment was a chimeric amalgam of different gene seeds from both loyalist and traitor gene lines. 

chimeric gene seed was kept secret and all records of its destruction during the storm of the heretech's base of operation were fabricated. It is assumed that no witnesses survived, although some evidence indicated that Pi-z-d1m's presence was detected in the noosphere after the destruction of his physical body.

A century later, Vrotter, now the right hand of fabricator general Hugh Vochko, was tasked with establishing a laboratory for raising a new chapter of space marines on their forgeworld, Ammplda

A ship with most precious gene stocks of the Imperial fists was sent over to the forgeworld from Terra, but the landing crafts suffered severe malfunctions and 1 of the 2 ships with the precious cargo was gone from the radars with smoke rising from one of its motors. In exactly 1 minute 28 seconds the ship re-emerged from the smoke clouds from between the spires of the manufactorum, intact.

Preliminary geneseed analysis was satisfactory.
Candidates were selected personally by Vrotter.
Implantation success rate was sub-optimal, but not beyond a critical margin.
A research into the fail rate was give a low priority and postponed until the implantation commenced in full. Then, the research hit a beurocratic brick wall that was not penetrated before the research team leader died of necrosis from his latest augmetic upgrades to the memory cores.

## disposition
For the next several hundred years, the codex compliant AZA chapter were protecting a region of space on the verge of the Ghoul stars between four sub-sectors in the Ultima segmentum

## Overview
Their fleet based strike forces would intercept pirate raid ships and hunt down pirate lords among the stars for hundreds of years, little bothered by anything but accumulating the precious resources and technology for the exploratory fleet that supported them.

They capitalized on sudden and brutal assaults on key enemy positions and retreating before the retribution came, bringing with them key enemy commanders and leaders and extracting information from them or extorting the enemy forces for negotiations/surrender. They were renowned for their diplomatic actions throughout the subsector and beyond as the benevolent listeners, as the givers of second chances, and as the allies of trust. 

The fact that they negotiated with any enemy of mankind (be it traitor, xenos, or heretic) at all was more than enough to draw the eyes of the inquisition, but after discovering the negotiations they proposed were always a part of an elaborate plan to draw out a bigger pray. 

Inquisition promptly omitted to mention this fact to anyone and kept it a secret. Hence their reputation spread among other military branches of the emperium and earned distrust of many. 

AZA were never in good relationships with other space marine chapters. This has not manifested in outright hostility and armed actions, but more honorable chapters outright refused to fight alongside AZA, the latter taking it in without a word of complaint spoken and with grim understanding.

They are notoriously unlucky with their timing of travels through the warp. They were late to arrive on such battles as
- [Lorn V](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Lorn_V) to support ultramarines and Cadians in their struggles to defend an imperial titan during the events of Dawn of War and then were chasing Gorgutz for 30 years.
- support ironhands at [Yspotua](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Yspotua) and only came by to clean up the remnants of hive fleet Leviathan's tendril in 997-998 M41
- Truub planets, as [Truub III](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Truub_III) and [Truub IX ](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Truan_IX)were exterminated by [Doom Warriors](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Doom_Warriors) for the presence of a chaos cults in 950s of M41
- [Raxos](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Raxos_Civil_War) civil war in 841 M41
- liberation of [Yrnax](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Yrnax) as Doom Eagles and Deathwatch made war on xenos warshipping cult sometime before 13th black crusade.
- [Bellus Prime](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Bellus_Prime) as it is currently under attack by necrons
